# Upgrades
Where possible, all upgrade scripts will be run automatically. MyBB Wiki does not, however, save backups of wiki articles for you. This must be done with the Import/Export function inside your Admin CP's Wiki module and on the article list before an upgrade or reinstall. As much as possible is saved in this process.

Upgrades also reset your settings and categories. Exported articles have the category in them and it has not (yet) been tested how the articles react with a non-existent category, but it should be only a minor issue.
