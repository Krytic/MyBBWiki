# Upgrading Instructions
## (that means read me before you download the update!)

Some upgrades change the Database Schema, and that's OK. It just means that you will have to run an upgrader. These can be found in the nav bar (on the left) under "Upgrades". You should upload all the files, overwriting any existing, and *then* run the updater. The updater preserves all of your data and makes the required schema changes.

Anything else you need to do specifically will be listed in the release notes on the left.
