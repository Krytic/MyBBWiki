Introduction & Installation
============================

Installing MyBB Wiki is as easy as pie.

First things first, `download the most recent stable version <https://github.com/Krytic/MyBBWiki/releases/latest>`_. The Wiki is continuously maintained to be compatible with the most recent MyBB Version, and is tested on PHP 5.6.16, though it *should* be compatible with PHP 7 (no guarantee made).

Once downloaded, unzip it and upload the contents to your server.

Log into MyBB, enter the Admin CP, and go Config > Plugins > Wiki > Install & Activate. The Wiki will autoinstall, and set up configuration and permissions. Then you can edit the permissions to your heart's content!
